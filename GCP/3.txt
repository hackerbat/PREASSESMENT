Steps to create bucket and transfer files from local to GCS using gsutil
1. In the console, type gsutil mb gs://[my-bucket]/
2. [BUCKET_NAME] is the name you want to give your bucket, subject to naming requirements.
3. gsutil mb -p [PROJECT_NAME] -c [STORAGE_CLASS] -l [BUCKET_LOCATION] -b on gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/
   1. -p: Specify the project with which your bucket will be associated. For example, my-project.
   2.  -c: Specify the default storage class of your bucket. For example, NEARLINE.
   3. -l: Specify the location of your bucket. For example, US-EAST1.
   4. -b: Enable uniform bucket-level access for your bucket.                
4. gsutil cp local-location/filename gs://my-bucket/
5. This is the command to copy the files to GCS
