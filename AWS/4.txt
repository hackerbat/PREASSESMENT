1. Create an instance of S3 bucket to host our webiste 

2.Name your s3 bucket as domain name so when the request comes to your s3 bucket,S3 uses the Host header in the request to route to the appropriate bucket.

3.Configure your S3 bucket to host our static website.
		
		Navigate to S3 in the AWS Console.
		Click into your bucket.
		Click the “Properties” section.
		Click the “Static website hosting” option.
		Select “Use this bucket to host a website”.
		Enter “index.html” as the Index document.

By default, any new buckets created in an AWS account deny you the ability to add a public access bucket policy. So we have to configure our bucket to grant public access.

4. Create a policy to grant access to everyone.
5.Next we need to map our domain name (website name) with the S3 url name (CNAME record) inside DNS RECORDS.
6. Upload your static webiste to s3 bucket.
